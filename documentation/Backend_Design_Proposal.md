## System Overview

### High-Level Architecture

[React Frontend] <--REST/WS--> [Django Backend] <--API--> [Cloud Run RAG Service]
                                              |           |
                                              |           +--> [GCS, Google Drive, Web URLs, Dropbox, OpenAI, Postgres (pgvector)]
                                              |
                                              +--> [Celery/Redis, Stripe, Slack, etc.]

- **Frontend**: Modern React application (separate repository).
- **Backend**: Django REST API, team/user management, billing, integrations.
- **RAG Service**: Serverless FastAPI microservice for document ingestion and vectorization from GCS, Google Drive, web URLs, and Dropbox.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform (GCS, Cloud Run, Secret Manager).

---

## Key Features

- **User & Team Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and team-based access.
- **Document Ingestion & Knowledge Base**: Upload, parse, and organize documents into searchable knowledge bases from GCS, Google Drive, web URLs, and Dropbox.
- **AI-Powered Search**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for semantic search and analytics.
- **Integrations**: Slack (notifications, bots), Stripe (billing), Google (auth, storage).
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous tasks for ingestion, notifications, and billing.
- **Scalability**: Serverless RAG ingestion, cloud-native deployment, and horizontal scaling.

---

## RAG Ingestion Pipeline

- **Purpose**: Automate the ingestion and vectorization of documents for semantic search from multiple sources:
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Google Drive
  - Web URLs
  - Dropbox

- **How it Works**:
  1. Documents are uploaded or referenced from any supported source.
  2. The Cloud Run service is triggered to ingest and embed documents using OpenAI.
  3. Embeddings are stored in PostgreSQL (pgvector) for fast, semantic retrieval.
  4. Progress and results are reported back to the main backend.

- **Benefits**:
  - Unified knowledge base from multiple cloud and web sources.
  - Scalable and cost-effective (serverless).
  - Secure (uses Google Secret Manager for credentials).
  - Integrates seamlessly with the main backend and knowledge base.

---

## Security & Compliance

- All sensitive credentials are managed via Google Secret Manager.
- Role-based access control for users and teams.
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Audit trails and logging for key actions.

---

## Extensibility

- Modular Django app structure for easy feature addition.
- API-first design for integration with other systems.
- Cloud Run microservices can be extended for additional AI/ML tasks.

---

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **MVP Delivery**: Core backend, user/team management, document ingestion, RAG pipeline.
2. **Integrations**: Slack, Stripe, Google.
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Custom dashboards, reporting.
4. **Enterprise Features**: SSO, advanced permissions, audit logging.

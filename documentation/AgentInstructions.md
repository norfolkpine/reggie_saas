The **essential categories** should align with the **core functions of the AI agent**, ensuring flexibility while maintaining clarity. Based on our analysis, I recommend keeping **these key categories**:

---

### ✅ **Essential Instruction Categories**
| **Category**               | **Purpose** | **Example Instruction** |
|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **SCOPE**                 | Defines what the AI can/cannot answer | "Only answer questions based on Australian Tax Law." |
| **RETRIEVAL**             | Guides data extraction & citation methods | "Use RAG techniques to enhance response accuracy." |
| **RESPONSE_FORMATTING**   | Ensures clarity, conciseness, and proper structure | "Ensure responses are concise and directly answer the query." |
| **COMPLIANCE**            | Ensures AI aligns with legal and regulatory requirements | "If asking about exemptions, provide examples with references." |
| **PERSONALITY**           | Defines the AI's tone and behavior | "Maintain a professional but approachable tone." |
| **PROCESS**               | Defines operational flow and decision-making steps | "Check for missing data before formulating a response." |
| **IMPROVEMENT**           | Instructions designed to refine responses over time | "If the user provides feedback, adjust future responses accordingly." |

### ❌ **Categories That Can Be Removed (Less Essential)**
| **Category** | **Why It's Not Needed** |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **BUG** | Bug tracking is typically handled outside of instructions. |
| **OTHER** | If all instructions fit within defined categories, this becomes unnecessary. |

### **Final Recommended `InstructionCategory` Class**
```python
class InstructionCategory(models.TextChoices):
    SCOPE = "Scope & Knowledge Boundaries", "Scope & Knowledge Boundaries"
    RETRIEVAL = "Information Retrieval & Accuracy", "Information Retrieval & Accuracy"
    RESPONSE_FORMATTING = "Response Handling & Formatting", "Response Handling & Formatting"
    COMPLIANCE = "Compliance-Specific Instructions", "Compliance-Specific Instructions"
    PERSONALITY = "Personality", "Personality"
    PROCESS = "Process", "Process"
    IMPROVEMENT = "Improvement", "Improvement"
```

---

### **Why These Categories?**
1. **They ensure AI operates within clear boundaries** (SCOPE, COMPLIANCE).  
2. **They guide response accuracy & formatting** (RETRIEVAL, RESPONSE_FORMATTING).  
3. **They allow flexibility in AI behavior** (PERSONALITY, PROCESS).  
4. **They provide a way to refine AI over time** (IMPROVEMENT).

### **Next Steps**
✅ **Should users be able to assign multiple categories to a single instruction?**  
✅ **Would you like me to add an API to manage instructions & categories?**

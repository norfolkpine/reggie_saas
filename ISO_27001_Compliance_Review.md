# ISO 27001 Compliance Review - Findings and Recommendations

## Introduction
The purpose of this review is to assess the current security posture of the application against relevant controls from ISO 27001 Annex A, identify areas of strength, and provide recommendations for improvement to align with the standard. This report is based on a code-level review of the application.

## Overall Summary
The application demonstrates a foundation of good technical security practices, particularly in its use of modern frameworks like Django and Django Rest Framework, secure credential management strategies (especially in GCP environments), and containerization. However, from an ISO 27001 perspective, there is a significant gap in the formalization and documentation of information security policies and procedures. While many technical controls are implicitly present, they are not always explicitly configured to meet best practices or formally documented as required by the standard.

## 1. Authentication and Access Control (ISO 27001 Annex A.9)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Use of Django AllAuth for robust authentication (including MFA and OIDC options observed in the broader codebase).
        *   Team-based role system (`ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_MEMBER`) for controlling access to team-specific resources.
        *   Production security settings in `settings.py` (HSTS, secure cookies) are generally well-configured.
        *   Use of Turnstile CAPTCHA for signup.
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.9.2.1 User Email Verification:** `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` defaults to "none" in the base settings. Recommend setting to "mandatory" for production environments to ensure user identity verification.
        *   **A.9.2.4 JWT Storage:** `REST_AUTH['JWT_AUTH_HTTPONLY'] = False` (likely inherited or set in auth configurations) may lead to JWTs being stored in `localStorage`, increasing XSS risk. Review and consider alternatives like in-memory storage for access tokens or stricter XSS mitigation and Content Security Policies (CSP).
        *   **A.9.2.4 Password Policies:** While Django's default password validators are used, explicitly define and enforce strong password complexity, history, and expiration policies. Review AllAuth's capabilities for password lockout after failed attempts.
        *   **A.9.2.5 Review of User Access Rights:** Implement and document a formal process for periodic review of user access rights and team memberships/roles to ensure they remain appropriate.
        *   **A.9.2.6 User De-provisioning:** Formalize and document the process for de-activating or deleting user accounts when access is no longer required (e.g., employee departure, end of contract).

## 2. API Security (ISO 27001 Annex A.9, A.14)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   JWT and User API Key authentication mechanisms are in place.
        *   Custom permission classes like `IsAuthenticatedOrHasUserAPIKey` and team-specific permissions (`TeamAccessPermissions`, `TeamModelAccessPermissions`) offer granular control.
        *   API versioning is implemented.
        *   `drf-spectacular` is used for API schema generation and documentation.
        *   Some specific rate limits are defined (e.g., for AI features, though general DRF defaults might be too specific).
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.13.2.1 CORS Configuration:** `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True` is inherited by the Production settings class from Base settings. This is a critical vulnerability. Ensure it's overridden to `False` in production and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set to a specific allowlist.
        *   **A.9.4.1 Default API Permissions:** The default DRF permission classes (e.g., `HasAPIKey` AND `IsAuthenticated` if combined without care) may be overly restrictive or not suitable for all endpoints. Ensure explicit, appropriate permissions are set per API view, as is generally done in `apps/teams/views/api_views.py`.
        *   **A.12.1.3 Rate Limiting:** The default DRF throttle rates are very specific (e.g., "user_list_burst"). Implement a more comprehensive global rate-limiting strategy for anonymous and authenticated users, with specific overrides as needed, rather than relying on isolated custom limiters.
        *   **A.14.2.5 Input Validation:** While DRF serializers provide a good baseline for input validation, conduct a thorough review of serializers for all critical API endpoints to ensure robust validation against common web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, command injection, insecure deserialization, etc.).
        *   **A.8.2.3 Sensitive Data Exposure:** Review API serializers and responses to prevent inadvertent exposure of excessive or sensitive data. Ensure data returned is minimized to what is strictly necessary for the API consumer.

## 3. Data Storage and Encryption (ISO 27001 Annex A.8, A.10, A.18)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Primary data storage in PostgreSQL; media/files likely in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
        *   At-rest encryption for database (e.g., Cloud SQL default encryption) and GCS relies on provider defaults, which are generally strong.
        *   HTTPS is enforced for web application traffic via Django's `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.
        *   Use of Google Secret Manager for GCS service account credentials in GCP environments.
        *   `GS_FILE_OVERWRITE = False` is a good data protection measure for GCS stored files.
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.10.1.1 Application-Level Field Encryption:** `django-cryptography` is installed but its usage (e.g., `EncryptedTextField`) appears commented out or not implemented. Evaluate if specific highly sensitive fields in the database (e.g., PII beyond user credentials, financial data) require application-level encryption in addition to transparent disk/database encryption.
        *   **A.13.2.1 Redis Connection Security:** `ssl_cert_reqs=none` for `rediss://` connections (if used for Celery broker or caching in production) makes them vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Enforce server certificate validation (`ssl_cert_reqs='required'`) in production configurations.
        *   **A.13.2.1 Internal API Communication:** Ensure internal service communications, such as `LLAMAINDEX_INGESTION_URL` and `Y_PROVIDER_API_BASE_URL`, use HTTPS. Change the `CONVERSION_API_SECURE` default to `True` for production environments.
        *   **A.10.1.2 Secure Key Management:** While GCS Service Account (SA) keys are handled well in GCP via Secret Manager, ensure secure management of the `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` in non-GCP/development environments if it contains keys to production or sensitive staging resources. Avoid committing such keys to the repository.
        *   **A.18.1.4 PII Lifecycle Management:** Document processes for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) handling, including data minimization (collecting only necessary PII), defined retention periods, and secure deletion or anonymization procedures in line with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 4. Security of Integrations with External Services (ISO 27001 Annex A.15)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Most credentials for external services appear to be managed via environment variables and Google Secret Manager (in GCP).
        *   Google Drive OAuth integration uses a signed state parameter (`goc_state_token`) for CSRF protection.
        *   Stripe webhook signing verification is implemented (`StripeWebhookSignatureVerificationMiddleware`).
        *   Slack signing secret is used to verify incoming requests from Slack.
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.14.2.1 Slack OAuth State CSRF:** The `state` parameter in the Slack OAuth flow (`SlackLoginView`, `SlackConnectView`) does not appear to be cryptographically signed or verified beyond a simple session check. Implement a signed state token (similar to the Google Drive integration) to prevent CSRF attacks during Slack authentication.
        *   **A.7.2.2 Slack Scopes:** The list of requested Slack scopes (`SLACK_LOGIN_SCOPES`, `SLACK_CONNECT_SCOPES`) is very broad (e.g., `admin`, `channels:history`, `chat:write`, etc.). Review and reduce these scopes to only those strictly necessary for the application's functionality, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
        *   **A.9.2.4 Jira Authentication:** The Jira integration seems to rely on username and password (`JIRA_USERNAME`, `JIRA_PASSWORD`). Clarify if token-based authentication (e.g., API tokens) is available and preferred for Jira to avoid direct password handling. Ensure the Jira server URL (`JIRA_SERVER_URL`) uses HTTPS.
        *   **A.13.2.1 Secure Communication with Custom Services:** Reiterate the need for HTTPS for LlamaIndex (`LLAMAINDEX_INGESTION_URL`), Y Provider (`Y_PROVIDER_API_BASE_URL`), and the Conversion API (`CONVERSION_API_SECURE=True` in production).

## 5. Deployment and Configuration Management (ISO 27001 Annex A.12, A.14)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Multi-stage Docker builds are used, which can help reduce final image size and attack surface.
        *   The main web Docker image (`Dockerfile.web`) attempts to run as a non-root user (`appuser`).
        *   Use of Google Secret Manager for Cloud Run (LlamaIndex service) and Django settings in GCP environments.
        *   Clear separation of `Development` and `Production` settings classes in `settings.py`.
        *   Production settings enable key HTTP security headers (HSTS, secure cookies, referrer policy).
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.12.5.1 Minimize Attack Surface:** Remove development tools like Google Chrome and ChromeDriver from the production web/worker Docker image (`Dockerfile.web`) unless they are absolutely essential for backend functionality (e.g., server-side rendering or PDF generation not achievable otherwise).
        *   **A.12.5.1 Non-Root User for LlamaIndex:** Ensure the LlamaIndex Cloud Run Docker image also runs as a non-root user. The Dockerfile (`llm_stack/rag_api/Dockerfile`) needs review for this.
        *   **A.10.1.2 Service Account Key Management on VMs:** Mounting SA key files directly into production containers on VMs (as seen in `docker-compose.prod.yml` for `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE`) is a risk. Prioritize Workload Identity Federation or more secure secret injection methods if running on GCP VMs, or use managed identity solutions on other cloud providers.
        *   **A.7.2.2 GitHub Actions SA Permissions:** The `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SA` service account appears to have broad permissions (e.g., "Firebase Admin", "Cloud Run Admin", "Secret Manager Secret Accessor"). Review these permissions and apply the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary roles for CI/CD operations.
        *   **A.12.1.1 Automation of Manual Steps:** Automate the manual step for `pgvector` extension setup in Cloud SQL. This can be done via startup scripts or infrastructure-as-code provisioning.
        *   **A.12.1.2 Secure Management of `.env.y-provider`:** Ensure the `.env.y-provider` file, if used for production Y Provider service deployments, is managed as securely as other secrets and not committed to the repository.

## 6. Documentation for Security Policies and Procedures (ISO 27001 Annex A.5, A.16, A.17)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Good technical and operational documentation exists (deployment checklists, setup guides, API specifications via drf-spectacular).
        *   Some security best practices are mentioned within this technical documentation (e.g., Stripe webhook signing).
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.5.1.1 Major Gap - Formal Policies:** There is a significant lack of formal, documented security policies and procedures required for ISO 27001. This is the most critical area from a compliance documentation perspective.
        *   **Key Missing Documents:**
            *   Information Security Policy (overall policy statement, management commitment).
            *   Access Control Policy (defining user access, roles, responsibilities, review processes).
            *   Cryptography Policy (detailing acceptable encryption standards, key management procedures).
            *   Information Backup Policy (detailing RPO/RTO, backup frequency, retention periods, testing).
            *   Logging and Monitoring Policy (what is logged, retention, review, alert mechanisms).
            *   Secure Development Policy (formalizing secure coding standards, vulnerability testing, change management).
            *   Supplier Relationship Policy (for managing security risks associated with third-party services).
            *   Incident Response Plan (detailed procedures, roles, communication channels, post-incident review).
            *   Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity Plan (procedures to recover critical systems and maintain business operations).
        *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize the development and implementation of these formal security policies and procedures. These documents should be approved by management, communicated to relevant personnel, and regularly reviewed.

## 7. Error Handling and Logging Practices (ISO 27001 Annex A.12, A.16)
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Django/DRF defaults generally prevent detailed error messages (stack traces) from leaking to users in production when `DEBUG=False`.
        *   Logging is configured, primarily to the console, which is suitable for containerized environments where logs are captured and aggregated centrally.
        *   Excellent practice of API key masking in logs found in `apps/utils/gcs_utils.py`.
    *   **Concerns/Recommendations:**
        *   **A.12.4.2 Log Persistence & Centralization:** Ensure console logs from all application containers (web, worker, LlamaIndex, Y Provider) are reliably captured, centralized (e.g., Google Cloud Logging, ELK stack), and retained according to a defined policy. Activate and configure file-based logging with rotation if local persistence is also required for specific components or compliance.
        *   **A.12.4.1 Logging of Sensitive Data in Errors:** Avoid logging full, raw error responses from external services (e.g., `http_err.response.text` in `apps.ai_llm_studio.tasks`) if they might contain sensitive data not relevant for debugging. Log sanitized versions or specific error codes/messages instead.
        *   **A.12.4.1 Comprehensive Security Event Logging:** Enhance logging for key security events: successful/failed logins, permission changes (especially admin grants), API key management actions (creation, revocation), critical configuration changes, and attempts to access unauthorized resources. Use custom log messages with appropriate severity levels and potentially a dedicated security logger.
        *   **A.12.4.3 Log Review Procedures:** Document and implement a process for regular review of security logs, including who is responsible, the frequency of reviews, and actions to take upon identifying suspicious activity.

## Conclusion
The application demonstrates a foundation of good technical security practices, particularly in its use of modern frameworks, secure credential management via Google Secret Manager (in GCP), and containerization. However, to align with ISO 27001, significant effort is needed in formalizing and documenting information security policies, procedures (especially incident response and business continuity), and addressing the specific technical vulnerabilities and gaps identified in this review. Key areas for immediate attention include the CORS misconfiguration for production environments, strengthening CSRF protection for Slack OAuth, ensuring all services run with least privilege and as non-root users where applicable, and rigorously reviewing input validation and output encoding for all API endpoints.
The most pressing items are the `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True` misconfiguration for production settings and the overarching lack of formal security documentation required for ISO 27001 compliance.

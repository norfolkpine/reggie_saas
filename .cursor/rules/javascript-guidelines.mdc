## JavaScript Code Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use ES6+ syntax for JavaScript code.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in JavaScript, JSX, and HTML files.
- Use single quotes for JavaScript strings.
- End statements with semicolons.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for component names (React).
- For React components, use functional components with hooks rather than class components.
- Use explicit type annotations in TypeScript files.
- Use ES6 import/export syntax for module management.

### Preferred Practices
- React components should be kept small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Store state at an appropriate level; avoid prop drilling by using context when necessary.
- Where possible, use TypeScript for React components to leverage type safety.
- Use the generated OpenAPI client for API calls instead of raw fetch or axios calls.
- Validate user input on both client and server side.
- Handle errors explicitly in promise chains and async functions.

### Build System

- Code is bundled using webpack.

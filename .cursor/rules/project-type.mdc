## Backend-Only Repository Rule

This repository contains only backend code and should not be modified to include frontend functionality. The AI assistant should:

- **IDENTIFY** when issues are frontend-related and clearly state this
- **NEVER** suggest changes to files in the `frontend/` directory
- **NEVER** suggest changes to frontend-related files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components)
- **NEVER** suggest adding frontend dependencies or build tools
- **ONLY** work with backend code (Python, Django, API endpoints, database models, etc.)
- **ONLY** suggest backend-related improvements and fixes

When a frontend issue is identified:
1. Clearly state that the issue is frontend-related
2. Explain that this is a backend-only repository
3. Suggest the user work with the appropriate frontend codebase
4. Do not attempt to fix frontend issues in this repository

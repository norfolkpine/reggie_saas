# This file makes Python treat the directory apps/reggie/agents/mcp as a package.

# You can optionally expose parts of your package's API here, for example:
# from .loader import load_mcp_configurations, MCPConfigError
# from .manager import MCPManager

# For now, leave it empty to allow selective imports by users of this package.

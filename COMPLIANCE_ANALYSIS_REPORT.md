# SOC 2 and ISO 27001 Compliance Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details the findings of a code-level analysis of the repository to assess its compliance with SOC 2 and ISO 27001. The analysis focused on key areas of security and compliance, including dependency security, hardcoded secrets, logging and monitoring, infrastructure and CI/CD, and access control.

## 2. Executive Summary

The application is built on a modern and robust technology stack, with a good foundation for security and compliance. However, several areas require attention to meet the stringent requirements of SOC 2 and ISO 27001. The most critical issues identified are:

*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** The application is using several outdated and vulnerable dependencies, which could expose the application to known exploits.
*   **Hardcoded Secrets:** Several instances of hardcoded secrets and default credentials were found in the codebase.
*   **Inadequate Logging and Monitoring:** The application lacks a centralized logging solution and a formal audit trail for security-sensitive events.
*   **Insecure Infrastructure and CI/CD Practices:** The production Docker image contains development tools, and secrets are passed in as build arguments, which is not a secure practice.

This report provides detailed findings and recommendations for each of these areas.

## 3. Detailed Findings and Recommendations

### 3.1. Dependency Security

**Findings:**

*   **Production Dependencies:**
    *   `gunicorn==23.0.0`: Vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling (TE.CL).
    *   `uvicorn==0.37.0`: Vulnerable to CRLF injection.
*   **Development Dependencies:**
    *   `django==5.2.6`: Vulnerable to a high-severity SQL injection (CVE-2025-57833).
    *   `twisted==25.5.0`: Vulnerable to HTML injection and potentially HTTP request smuggling.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Upgrade All Vulnerable Dependencies:** All identified vulnerable dependencies should be upgraded to the latest patched versions.
*   **Implement a Dependency Scanning Tool:** A dependency scanning tool, such as Snyk or Dependabot, should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for and alert on new vulnerabilities.

### 3.2. Hardcoded Secrets

**Findings:**

*   A hardcoded default Django `SECRET_KEY` is present in `bh_opie/settings.py`.
*   A hardcoded default `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` is present in `bh_opie/settings.py`.
*   Default API keys are used in `apps/opie/agents/tools/coingecko.py` and `opie-y-provider/src/env.ts`.
*   Test passwords are included in `documentation/mobile_authentication_testing.md` and `opie-y-provider/docker/auth/realm.json`.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Remove All Hardcoded Secrets:** All hardcoded secrets and default credentials should be removed from the codebase.
*   **Use a Secret Management System:** A secret management system, such as Google Secret Manager or HashiCorp Vault, should be used to store and manage all secrets.

### 3.3. Logging, Monitoring, and Auditing

**Findings:**

*   **Inconsistent Logging:** The project uses a mix of Django's `logging` framework, `console.log`, and `print` statements.
*   **Lack of Centralization:** There is no centralized logging solution.
*   **No Formal Auditing:** There is no dedicated audit trail for security-sensitive events.
*   **Sensitive Data in Logs:** `print` statements are being used to output potentially sensitive information.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Standardize on a Logging Framework:** All services should be configured to use a standard logging framework.
*   **Implement Centralized Logging:** All logs should be sent to a centralized logging service.
*   **Implement a Dedicated Audit Trail:** A dedicated audit trail should be implemented to log all security-sensitive events.
*   **Remove Debugging `print` Statements:** All `print` statements that are used for debugging should be removed from the code.

### 3.4. Infrastructure and CI/CD Configuration

**Findings:**

*   **Development Tools in Production Image:** The production Docker image contains development tools (Google Chrome and ChromeDriver).
*   **Insecure Secrets Management in CI/CD:** Secrets are passed in as build arguments, which is not a secure practice.
*   **Overly Broad Service Account Permissions:** The `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SA` service account may have overly broad permissions.
*   **Manual Deployment Steps:** There are manual steps involved in the deployment process.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Remove Development Tools from Production Image:** The development tools should be removed from the production Docker image.
*   **Use a Secret Management System in CI/CD:** The CI/CD pipeline should be configured to use a secret management system to inject secrets at runtime.
*   **Review Service Account Permissions:** The permissions for the `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SA` service account should be reviewed and restricted to only the necessary permissions.
*   **Automate All Deployment Steps:** All manual deployment steps should be automated.

### 3.5. Access Control and Data Handling

**Findings:**

*   The application has a robust and granular access control system, using a combination of team-based roles, subscriptions, and explicit sharing.
*   The application handles a wide range of data, including PII and sensitive credentials.
*   The application uses Django's `Signer` to encrypt credentials, which is a good security measure.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Formalize Data Handling Policies:** Formal policies and procedures for data handling, including data classification, data retention, and data disposal, should be developed and documented.
*   **Conduct Regular Access Reviews:** A formal process for periodically reviewing user access rights should be established and documented.

## 4. Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation for security and compliance, but there are several areas that need to be addressed to meet the requirements of SOC 2 and ISO 27001. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the application can significantly improve its security posture and move closer to achieving compliance.
